### 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a curious engineer-in-the-making, currently pursuing my B.Tech in **Electronics and Communication Engineering** from **IIIT Nagpur**.  
I specialize in **hardware-driven problem solving** — with hands-on experience in:
- Embedded Firmware (ESP32, BLE)
- Circuit & Sensor Integration
- IoT Systems involving Firebase and web dashboarding

Outside the tech world, I’ve led cultural initiatives as Club Head at Estoria, helping me grow as a **leader**, **communicator**, and **team player**.
